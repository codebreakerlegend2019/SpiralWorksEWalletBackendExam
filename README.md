# SpiralWorksEWalletBackendExam
A Actual Coding Technical Exam from a company named Spiral Works. It will do such a basic E-Wallet Backend API Functions.

I used Azure SQL Database into this since I have a free subscription at the moment, now if someone from Spiral Works will test this kindly contact me at my email: joshuasiuagan0406@gmail.com for me to put on the IP Address of the accessor of the SQL from my project because it has a Firewall rule from Azure SQL Database.

Thank You !!!
